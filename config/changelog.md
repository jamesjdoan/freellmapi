# Changelog

## 2026-09-02

- Added opt-in preferred provider ordering for unified models while preserving automatic routing, health gates, cooldowns and failover.
- Added explicit quota scope/accounting metadata and exact-pool routing eligibility for shared, per-model, project/model, monetary, unknown and local-unmetered capacity.
- Preserved legacy Groq and Google quota observations through conservative read fallbacks; exact new-pool observations take precedence.
- Added catalogue-backed per-key model selection and per-credential RPM, RPD and TPD controls.
- Propagated quota context through OpenAI chat, Responses and Anthropic-compatible request paths.
- Added a source-linked, dated free-tier guidance catalogue for the seven configured providers, with advisory freshness/conflict states and a reviewed Codex refresh contract.
- Added atomic provider/model RPM, RPD, TPM and TPD editing beside key model access, plus confirmed application of verified guidance.
- Added a Model Scope copy action that exports concise provider/free-model configuration and sourced quota guidance for LLM review without credential or internal identity data.
